## Overview

**Story Mode** is an extension for SillyTavern that provides tools for a stronger narrative experience while chatting with LLMs. 
## Key Features

### 📖 Story Style
Choose from **43 pre-defined story genres** - Mystery, Horror, Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Romance, Action, Drama, and more. Each story type includes:
- Thematic hooks and tone guidance
- Genre-appropriate tropes and literary devices
- Pacing and POV suggestions
- Three-act structure templates

These can be used to provide a loose strucutre to your rolepay.

### ✍️ Author Style
Emulate the writing style of popular authors. The LLM adopts their voice, prose rhythm, description techniques, and dialogue patterns. Includes optional NSFW/mature content guidance tailored to each author's style.

### 🎭 Mix and Match
Combine any story genre with any author style:
- Tell a **Spy Thriller** in the style of Jane Austen
- Tell a **Romance** in the style of Hemingway
- Tell **Cosmic Horror** in the style of Tolkien

### 🎬 Narrative Arc
Set your story to follow a loose arc over any number of messages (5–50+). The LLM receives phase-specific guidance as it progresses through:
- **Setup** (~33%): Establish world, characters, and conflict
- **Escalation** (~33%): Raise stakes and deepen challenges
- **Resolution** (~33%): Climax and conclusion.

### 🗺️ Scenario Blueprints
Tell structured, multi-scene stories with:
- Scene-by-scene progression and beat tracking
- LLM-generated narrative plans tailored to your premise
- Opening messages and cover art per blueprint
- Signal-based pacing (`@@BEAT:N@@`, `@@NEXT_SCENE@@`)

### 🖼️ Scenario Library
Store your scenario blueprints as **PNG images** with embedded metadata. Export them as files and share with others—import them right back into any browser.

### 📜 End of Chat tools
- **Epilogue**: Automatically generate a story epilogue when the arc completes
- **Summarization**: Generate a summary of any chat at any time
- **What's Next**: The LLM will generate ideas for your next scenario.

### 🎨 Theme Integration
Integrates seamlessly with SillyTavern theming, including specific support for **Rivelle's Moonlight Echoes** and **SpicyMarinara's RPG Companion**.

## Inspiration & Credits

**Author**: Eco54

**Research & Inspiration**
The Scenario Blueprint system is a partial implementation of the **StoryVerse** approach to narrative roleplaying:
[*StoryVerse: Towards Co-authoring Dynamic Plot with LLM-based Character Simulation via Narrative Planning*](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3649921.3656987)
(Wang et al., 2024, Autodesk Research)

**Inspiration (and some code) borrowed from:**
- [Moonlight Echoes](https://github.com/RivelleDays/SillyTavern-MoonlitEchoesTheme) by Rivelle
- [RPG Companion](https://github.com/SpicyMarinara/rpg-companion-sillytavern) by SpicyMarinara and others
- [Auto Gen Image](https://github.com/wickedcode01/st-image-auto-generation/blob/main/README_EN.md) by wickedcode01
- and of course SillyTavern!
